An open-source Python package that provides both a graphical user interface (GUI) and an application programming interface (API) for for working with impedance spectra:

- load experimental data from various file formats
- process spectra (e.g., mask outliers and make corrections by subtracting a baseline spectrum)
- validate spectra using Kramers-Kronig transforms
- analyze spectra using equivalent circuits and by calculating distributions of relaxation times
- simulate the impedance response of circuits
- visualize spectra and analysis results

DearEIS is based upon [pyimpspec](https://vyrjana.github.io/software/pyimpspec) and the GUI is built using [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui).
