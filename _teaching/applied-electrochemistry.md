Supervision of a lab exercise regarding the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

The exercise covers the following topics:

- basics of impedance spectroscopy
	- excitation and response signals
	- requirements for valid linear EIS measurements
	- performing measurements
- data processing and analysis
	- analysis of simple circuits (resistor, capacitor, series RC, and parallel RC)
	- validation using Kramers-Kronig transforms
	- equivalent circuit fitting
	- analysis of a more complex circuit

The course is organized each autumn and I have supervised this exercise since 2017. The course is in English.

In 2017 I also supervised another lab exercise in this course involving the electropolymerization of pyrrole onto a glassy carbon electrodes in both the presence and the absence of sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded for both electrodes. The electrodes were then used as rudimentary cation- and anion-selective electrodes in potentiometric calibration measurements.
